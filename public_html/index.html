            <b>So, what is Git in a nutshell?</b>
            <p>
              This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.

            <h2>Is Git the Same Thing as Github!?</h2>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/github2.png" alt="Git is not github"/>
            <p>
              I was trying to tell a friend the other day how Git and Github are related. Where does Git end and Github start? What do they each even do for you?
            </p>
            <p>
              I realised that it's actually one of those fundamental things that is worth stepping through and getting a clear understanding. If you've been using the terms interchangeably, the distinction makes a good backdrop to learn more, and getting clarity will enable you to steer past a whole bunch of confusion later on.
